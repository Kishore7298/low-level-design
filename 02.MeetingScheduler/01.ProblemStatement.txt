Goals of the system:

1. Book a room for the meeting and return the name of the room booked.
2. History of the meetings booked.

Write an API which accepts start time and an end time, and returns the meeting room name for the booked 
scheduled time.

Exercise:
1. Extend the current duration from a day to multiple days.
2. The API to book a slot can be like
    string Scheduler::book(int day, int start, int end);
3. You're Free to modify the code as per your need. If it suits you, even erase the entire code 
    and write your own from scratch. The only Requirement is to schedule the meeting(s) via the API on the given day.
