Task Planner:

1. Sprint: A sprint is a short, time boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work.
2. Task: Any feature scheduled in the sprint is broken down into specific technical tasks. These tasks are used
    by teams to decompose user stories or items to a more granular level.

The task planner should have following functionalities:
-> User should be able to create task of type Story, Feature, Bug. Each can have their own status.
-> Stories can have further substracts.
-> Should be able to change the status of any task.
-> User should be able to create any sprint. Should be able to add any task to sprint and remove from it.

The users should be able to print
    * Delayed Task(s).
    * Sprint details
    * Tasks assigned to the user.
